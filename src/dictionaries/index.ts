/**
 * DICTIONARY (other names are map, symbol table, associative array):
 * Stores values in pairs as [key, value].
 * Dictionaries can only store a single value per key.
 */

/**
 * HASH:
 * Hash also store values in pairs, however data structure implementation is
 * a little bit different as dictionaries can only store single value per key.
 */

/**
 * Similarities: Dictionary, Hash, Set all store unique values(non-repeated values)
 * Differences: Set stores a [key, key] collection of elements.
 * A dictionary stores [key, value] collection of elements. Where key is used to find element.
