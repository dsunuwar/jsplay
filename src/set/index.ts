export * from './set';
/**
 * Set is a collection of unique unordered elements. This data structure uses the same mathematical
 * concept as finite sets.
 *
 * Example:
 * A set of natural numbers, which consists of integer numbers greater than or equal to 0,
 * N = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,...}.
 *
 * A set with no element is called null set or empty set. Example, a set of prime numbers
 * between 24 and 29, would be, N = {}, since there are not prime numbers.
 *
 * Operations:
 * Set has basic operations such as union, intersection and difference.
 *
 * Application of Set:
 * One of the main applications of set in computer science is in databases.
 * Sets are used in query design and processing. DB queries are designed using set notation.
 * These operations are known in the SQL world as join, union, intersections
